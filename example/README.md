## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Running the application

1. Make sure you have [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed.

2. The example app showcases the Survicate integration, so you will need to get your own Survicate account. Create an account [here](https://survicate.com/).

3. Set your Survicate `workspaceKey` following the [documentation](https://developers.survicate.com/mobile-sdk/flutter).

4. Run `flutter run` on the example
